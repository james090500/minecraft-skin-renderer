# Minecraft Skin Renderer
Renders a 3D minecraft skin using PHP. Work in progress.

## Usage
    echo  MinecraftSkinRenderer::render('./images/james090500.png');
The constructor currently only excepts files but will accept image streams and base64 in the future. Output is currently a png with a Header already set. Again this will change in the future.
